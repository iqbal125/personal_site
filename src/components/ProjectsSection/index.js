      This was one of the most difficult projects Ive ever done. It was a full
      authentication server, built from the ground up. What made it particularly
      hard was that there were literally no tutorials on the internet on how to
      do it. The especially tricky parts were the “password reset” and “password
      forget” features, but I was able to get it done through a lot of trial and
      error. I also had to learn a lot of complex concepts like cryptography and
      hashing passwords.
