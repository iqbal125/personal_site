    description: `Worked on a team of 5 engineers and 1 PM on this project. We built a job application tracking app with React, Node, and Postgres. I helped code for all parts of the app including front end, server side and database. I built out the entire authentication system with Firebase Auth as well. This was a good learning experience, because I learned to work with the knex ORM which I didn't know previously. I also learned about web design and UX research from the PM.   `,

    description: `Added Auth0 Authentication in an existing internal app. I first integrated the authentication to the internal front end app, then integrated it to the node server. I also set up all the configuration on the Auth0 site. I worked very closely with the client in this one and was coding while with him on the phone a few times. I explained how Auth0 and JWT authentication works to the client in order to help him make the best decisions about what authentication solution to go with. `,

    title: "Postgres Server Side Auth",
    description: `This was one of the most difficult projects I've ever done. It was a full authentication server, built from the ground up. 
      What made it particularly hard was that there were literally no tutorials on the internet on how to do it. The especially tricky parts were the “password reset” and “password forget” features, but I was able to get it done through a lot of trial and error. 
      I also had to learn a lot of complex concepts like cryptography and hashing passwords. `,

    title: "Concord Site",
    description: `Built a web Dev agency site from scratch. I built this site entirely in Gatsby, a React static site generator. This was a fun project that let me explore the full capabilities of Gatsby and showed me how powerful and versatile it was, and not just a simple static site generator. I learned about popular modern styling in this app with illustrations and svg waves. The text truncation on the profile cards was also an elegant solution I was proud of on this project.`,
