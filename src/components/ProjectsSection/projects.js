    details: `This was one of the most difficult projects Ive ever done. It was a full authentication server, built from the ground up. 
      What made it particularly hard was that there were literally no tutorials on the internet on how to do it. The especially tricky parts were the “password reset” and “password forget” features, but I was able to get it done through a lot of trial and error. 
      I also had to learn a lot of complex concepts like cryptography and hashing passwords. `,
